# Enhancing Waste Management Sustainability through Smart and Incentivized Sorting
 
Abstract— This paper presents an intelligent waste sorting system that utilizes computer vision and deep learning to accurately categorize waste items. Moreover, the system incentivizes proper waste disposal through a rewards scheme. Testing indicated over 90% accuracy in classifying waste into multiple categories. This sustainable solution has strong potential to address critical waste management challenges.
