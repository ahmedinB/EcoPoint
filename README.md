# EcoPoint - Enhancing Waste Management Sustainability through Smart and Incentivized Sorting
 
Abstractâ€” This paper presents an intelligent waste sorting system that utilizes computer vision and deep learning to accurately categorize waste items. Moreover, the system incentivizes proper waste disposal through a rewards scheme. Testing indicated over 90% accuracy in classifying waste into multiple categories. This sustainable solution has strong potential to address critical waste management challenges.
